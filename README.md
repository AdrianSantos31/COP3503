These are the projects for Computer Science 2.

Homework 1

This program will compute the cost of driving based on the:
   A.) Driving distance,
   B.) Fuel efficiney of the car in miles per gallon
   C.) Price per gallon
   
Homework 2

This program combines problems 5.24 and 5.25
   5.24 - Sum a series
   5.25 - Compute pI (Ï€)
   
Homework 3

This program will process an array. This class contains a lot arrays

Homework 4

Your code must override the toString method in each class to display ALL the relevant information from the record.
Also design an application class (your nnumber class with a main)  that tests your classes and processes a file of records.
The file of data to be used will be constructed by me with the following format used (examples are here):
I WILL USE NOTEPAD TO CONSTRUCT THE FILE. TEST WITH A FILE FROM NOTEPAD.

Homework 5

OOP Using Alice

Homework 6

 Write a single program that produces Figure 14.52 (part b)  and
        Figure 14.48  (part a)  and Figure 14.45 (part b).  All three should be visible at
        the same time in a single window.
        In addition, the clock (figure 14.52 part b)should have your name inside it, displayed
        horizontally
        between the 9 and the 3.  Note that the time displayed is based upon random numbers and
        should vary with each run.
        A single program should only produce a single display of all three figures. Resizing of the
        window should be
        possible and should preserve the figures as much as possible.
        
Homework 7
Write a program that uses a BorderPane that:
1. starts with two buttons on the bottom and your name on the screen and the two buttons should be programmed for up and down
instead of left and right, similar to example 16.2. Only use the left half of the center for your name (1 row 2 columns). See number 5
below for the right half of the center. So you could use a GridPane for the center.
2. enhances 16.2 with checkboxes that permit your name to be bold and/or italicized but the font must be  something other
than Times New Roman, and these checkboxes must be on the left (not the right) , similar to example 16.3
3. enhances 16.3 with  3 radio buttons that paint the text colors that are colors of your choice, but not red, green or blue,
and these radio buttons must be on the right (not the left), similar to example 16.4. You can use RGB coloring if you like.
4. puts a bouncing red rectangle (not a ball)  at the top  with a slider for speed (see see 16.12).
5. puts an mp4 video of something you have produced in the right half of the center with the same controls as in 16.14.
